 * Pokémon-7

 *
 * Few franchises have achieved the degree of fame as Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters",
 * a Japanese monster-catching phenomenon that took the world by storm in the late 90s. Even
 * to this day, Pokémon is hugely successful, with games, movies, and various other forms of
 * merchandise selling like crazy. The game formula itself is an addicting take on the JRPG,
 * where the player can not only fight random Pokémon in the wild but also recruit them to
 * be in their party at all times, where they can level up, learn new abilities, and even evolve.
 *
 * This proof of concept demonstrates basic GUI usage, random encounters, and Pokémon that the
 * player can fight and defeat with their own Pokémon.
